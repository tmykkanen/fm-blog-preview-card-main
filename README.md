## My process

1. Set up dev environment w/ pnpm, tailwindcss, and live-server.
2. Set up tailwind component classes for easy font application.
3. Write semantic HTML to scaffold project.
4. Style semantic HTML with tailwind.

### What I learned

- I'm most familiar with frameworks with a dev evn already set up. So I learned how to use tailwind cli and set up a live server with hot reloading.
- I read up on some semantic HTML and tried small, figure, etc. rather than divs.
- I looked at several options for animating the drop shadow, including css pseudo elements. I ended up just using keyframe animation with the regular css properties, but the reading helped me understand pseudo elements better.

### Continued development

- I'd like to improve my intuitive understanding of css flex.
- I'd like to continue diving deeper into tailwind best practices (e.g. build components with @apply or style directly with utility classes?).
